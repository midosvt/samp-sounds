# SA-MP Sound IDs
## Introduction
A lot of sounds cannot be found in the official sa-mp/open.mp wiki like at https://www.open.mp/docs/scripting/resources/sound-ids that's why I created this repository.

There was an old link to pastebin containing them but it got deleted, and that's why, again, we're making this.

## Use
These sounds can be used with [`PlayerPlaySound`](https://www.open.mp/th/docs/scripting/functions/PlayerPlaySound).

Example:
```pawn
// Player punching sound (fits for commands such as /slap well). 
PlayerPlaySound(playerid, 1130, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
```

> [!NOTE]
> You have to use sound ID 0 to stop the sound ID that is currently playing.
